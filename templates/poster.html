        I forked the repo on GitHub and then used <code>git clone</code> to make a local copy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the repo was on my own machine I was able to commit changes to version control
        as I went along, and I pushed back up to my GitHub repo at the end of each day.
        I followed GitHub's instructions and set up a SSH key so I didn't need to enter
        username and password every time I pushed.
