        <h2>0-GET Get the source code</h2>
      <p>
        I forked the repo onto my GitHub and then used the <code>$ git clone ssh://github.com/mahid2000/CS1999-buggy-race-editor.git</code>
        command on the git bash terminal to clone the repository onto my local machine.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the repo was on my own machine I was able to commit changes to version control
        as I went along, and I pushed back up to my GitHub repo at the end of each day.
        I followed GitHub's instructions and set up a SSH key so I didn't need to enter
        username and password every time I pushed.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="task">
        <h2>0-RUN Get app running and view it in a browser</h2>
        <p>
          I opened a git bash to the cloned buggy editor directory on my local machine and installed all the required 
          python libraries using <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code> . To run the webserver I used the command 
          <code>Python app.py</code> which output <code>* Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000/ </code> telling me the adress 
          of the webpage which I copied and pasted into my browser to be greeted with the index page of the buggy editor. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I used <code>ssh</code> instead of <code>https</code> as I had already set up the ssh key on my 
            local machine allowing me easy secure access to github without having to log-in evry time.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="task">
        <h2>0-CHANGE Make a change to a template and see it appear</h2>
        <p>
          To make sure that the webpage was being updated properly I conducted a 'smoke test' of sorts by editing the <code>index.html</code> 
          file and observing the changes appear. I chanegd the heading from 'Buggy Editor' to 'Mahids Buggy Editor' and refeshed the page. 
          The title was sucessfuly changed confirming that the templates were being used sucessfuly in the manner they were inteded. If the 
          webpage hadnt changed after refreshing then that wouldve indiucated that I was in the wrong repo.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="task">
        <h2>1-ADD Add more data to the form</h2>
        <p>
          To add more items to the form i edited the <code>buggy-form.html</code> template. I used the html <code><'input'></code> tags to allow 
          for the form to collect data from users. I also used other html input tags such as 'radio, selct' to 
          collect data aswell. Html tags such as <code><'p'>,<'h'>,<'a href:""'>,<'img'></code> were used to show 'paragraphs', 'headings', 'links' and 'images' respectively.
        </p>
        <p>
          Later down the development stage I created my own html tags and tag classes such as <code>a.download</code> which is the tag for a download button. 
          (P.S. You can find it on this page!!!)
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="task">
        <h2>1-VALID Add basic data validation</h2>
        <p>
          To validate data I edited the <code>app.py</code> file. All the data processing SHOULD ocurr in the <code>'GET'</code> script as that is when the form 
          is returned to us with the data. Within this script we must first load all the data inputs from the form using <code>var = request.form['var']</code>.
          After loding all the variables in I used if and elif loops to return error messages. For basic data such as numbers I used the <code>.isdigit()</code> syntax to find out if the input was a number, if it wasnt then i returned a error.
        </p>
        <p>
          To pass the error back to user I added up the errors to a string variable <code>msg</code> which I then returned with the <code>buggy-form.html</code> template. I used <code>{{msg}}</code> which allowed me to display the error messages in the returned buggy form template.
        </p>
    </div>
  
    <div class="task">
        <h2>1-STYLE Style your editor just how you like it</h2>
        <p>
          I used and created a variety of html tags in the <code>app.css</code> file to style my buggy editor. In the css file I modified the colour, borders, styles and other variables to give it a distinct look. I used a checkerted pattern using gradients to create a racing flag background. However to make the page more user friendly I ahd to tone down the transparency of the background colours and place a light white background behind any writing elements. I done this by editing the background colour and transparency of a div class called spacer.
        </p>
        <p>
          To make the css changes load I had to prevent the browser from caching. I done this by making the pages dynamic using the instructins from the cache busting notes on css TechNotes. I also managed to use a picture as a link for this poster. 
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="task">
        <h2>2-EDIT Edit the record by loading its current values into the form</h2>
        <p>
           I allowed the previously inputed values to be laoded into the form by using delimiters to use python inside the <code>'buggy-form.html'</code>  to fo if conditional loops like 'if buggy['key'] == ""'... value == ""  .The delimiters extend the functionality of python and the variables into html. This allowed me to succesfuly preload the form with values that I had previously uploaded to the database.
        </p>
        <p>
           I succesfully did this however when doing 3-Multi, it broke due to a bug with the buggy keys.... so it will not be in the final version :(
        </p>
    </div>
      
    <div class="task">
        <h2>2-FORM Make the form better</h2>
        <p>
          To make the form better I used CSS styling to make the writing easier to read by placing white backgrounds and  centering the buttons and headings to the centre of the page.
        </p>

    </div>

    <div class="task">
        <h2>2-COST Calculate and save the game cost of the buggy</h2>
        <p>
            To do cost I used If loops in the 'POST' script to add to a initialised variable caleld cost. I then returned cost to the updated form and uploaded ti to the databse. I also used a if statement to check if the cost was more than the 'LEGAL_VAL' (which is a constant variable which can be manualy changed by changing it in the code depending on what the max cost of the buggy was for each race), and if it was I returned a error message in the same way i did in 3-valid.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also added a pound sign and returned it to the updated page where i used <code>{{cost}}</code> to show the cost. The same was done for weight.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="task">
        <h2>2-RULES Add validation according to the game rules</h2>
        <p>
          For the rules I used the same method as 1-VALID but replaced the conditions in the if stateemnts with the rules for each input, which if not followed, would reasult in a error message. The rules were obtained from the buggy race server spec.
        </p>

      <h2>3-ENV Switch between dev and production environments</h2>

    <div class="task">
        <h2>3-MULTI Allow different buggies to be created</h2>
        <p>
            I followed the vieos on 3 multi to allow me to create and display multiple buggies and their tables. This was done by changing the buggy id from a default=1 to a range of id's inputted by the form.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="task">
        <h2>3-DEL Allow buggies to be deleted</h2>
        <p>
            I used app.route and the swl fuctions to SELECT and DELETE each buggy
        </p>
